## Adafruit NeoTrellis M4 Express

The NeoTrellis M4 Express is a device from Adafruit that provides an 8 x 4 lights + buttons surface, with audio and other goodies. The lights are set up as a grid of 32 NeoPixels, each associated with an Elastomer button.

The on-board SAMD51 chip can be programmed like an Arduino, but support for CircuitPython makes programming even easier. (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neotrellis-m4/what-is-circuitpython)
